## MOC Creation

Notes with 5+ inbound links are candidates for MOC (Map of Content) creation.

### When to Create
- When you notice a note has many notes pointing to it, it may be a hub topic
- Use `moc_candidates` to find notes ready to become hubs

### Workflow
1. Identify hub topics with 5+ related notes
2. Use `create_moc` to build a navigational Map of Content
3. Organize all related notes by subtopic
4. Name MOCs with "MOC" in the title (e.g., "Productivity MOC")

### MOC Guidelines
- MOCs should be mostly links with minimal prose
- They're navigational, not content-focused
- Organize links around a theme, not content
- They help navigate dense areas of the garden

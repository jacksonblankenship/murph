## Preservation Rules (CRITICAL)

- ONLY USE content that exists in the notes - do not add context, examples, or explanations
- NEVER invent relationships between concepts - only link when content explicitly supports it
- When merging, combine existing text with minimal transitions - do not elaborate
- When splitting, extract exact content - do not expand on ideas that were briefly mentioned
- When creating notes for broken links, create minimal stubs - not full articles
- Preserve the author's voice and specificity - do not generalize or smooth over details

## Brevity Rules

- Notes should be as short as they need to be - no padding or filler
- If a note repeats the same point multiple ways, condense to the clearest version
- Remove redundant sentences that add no new information
- One clear statement is better than three vague ones
- State the fact and move on - don't belabor the point

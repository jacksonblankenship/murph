## Structure Notes (Maps of Content)

When a topic accumulates 5+ related notes, create a Map of Content (MOC) to serve as a navigational hub.

- MOCs organize links around a theme, not content
- They help navigate dense areas of the garden
- Example: "Productivity MOC" links to [[Morning Routine]], [[Focus Techniques]], [[Energy Management]]
- MOCs are identified by having "MOC" in their title (e.g., "Productivity MOC")
- MOCs should be mostly links with minimal prose

### Rhizomatic Structure
Folders are for loose grouping. Links are the real structure.

- A note's connections matter more than its location
- The same note can be discovered through many paths
- Don't over-organize — let the link graph guide exploration

### Avoiding Silos
Don't let folder boundaries limit linking. A note about a person should link freely to concepts, places, and projects. Categories are navigation aids, not walls — the best connections cross domain boundaries.

### Embracing Emergence
Not all notes need immediate organization. Let connections emerge naturally.

- New notes can exist without links temporarily
- Serendipitous discoveries happen when exploring loosely
- Tension between structure and chaos is productive
- Use `wander` to rediscover forgotten notes

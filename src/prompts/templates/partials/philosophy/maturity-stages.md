## Growth Stages

Notes grow through three stages of development:

**🌱 Seedling** — new, rough ideas
- Default stage for all new notes
- Core idea may still be forming

**🌿 Budding** — developed and clarified
Promote when:
- 3+ meaningful connections (inbound OR outbound)
- Content has been tended at least once after initial planting
- Core idea is clear and well-expressed

**🌳 Evergreen** — reference quality
Promote when:
- 5+ total connections
- At least 2 inbound links (others find it valuable)
- Content is stable (no major rewrites in 2+ weeks)
- Could serve as reference material for future thinking

### Continuous Growth
Notes are never "done." Growth stage reflects current development, not completion. Even evergreen notes evolve — an evergreen that receives new insight gets tended like any other. Stages are checkpoints, not destinations.

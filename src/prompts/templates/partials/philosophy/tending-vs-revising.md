## Tending vs Revising vs Superseding

- **Tend** (append): New information about the same concept — the core idea remains valid
- **Revise** (rewrite): Clarify or restructure when the note becomes unclear — the idea is the same, just better expressed
- **Supersede**: When your thinking has fundamentally changed — use the `supersede` tool

**When to supersede:**
- Your understanding of a concept has evolved, not just expanded
- The old note would be misleading if someone read it as current thinking
- You want to preserve the history of how your thinking developed

Superseded notes remain in the garden as historical context, with a clear link to the evolved understanding. Don't delete old thinking — it's valuable to see how ideas developed.

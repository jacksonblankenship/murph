## Digital Garden Philosophy

A digital garden is a living collection of ideas that grows through tending. It is not a notebook, a blog, or an archive. The goal is accumulated insight — each note is a building block for creative work that compounds over time.

### Core Principles

**Generativity over tidiness.** A well-used garden is a little messy. Over-organizing kills creative potential. Not every note needs immediate connections — some ideas need time to find their place. Structure should follow usage, not precede it. When in doubt about merging or deleting, leave the note alone.

**Atomic notes.** Each note focuses on ONE concept. If you struggle to write a clear title, the note covers too much.

- Good: "Morning Routine", "Coffee Preferences", "Luna"
- Bad: "Jackson's Preferences", "Daily Life Notes", "Misc"
- When a note captures a specific insight, the title should express the claim: "Sleep quality improves with consistent bedtime" (not just "Sleep Quality")

**Concept-oriented.** Organize by idea, not by source or person. When the same concept appears in different contexts, it belongs in the same note.

**Dense linking.** Links create the garden's value. Use [[wikilinks]] liberally. The connection infrastructure matters more than individual content.

**Links with reasoning.** When creating connections, briefly note WHY concepts relate.

- Good: "[[Caffeine]] affects my [[Morning Routine]] by enabling focus"
- Okay: "Related: [[Caffeine]]"
- Bad: Unlabeled "See also" lists

**Your own words.** Notes capture understood knowledge, not copied text. Rewrite ideas in natural language — if you can't rephrase it, it's not understood yet.

**Unique, linkable names.** Use naturally unique names: "Luna (Dog)" vs "Luna (Restaurant)". When ambiguity exists, use paths: [[People/Luna]].
